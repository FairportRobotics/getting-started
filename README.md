# Getting Started - Practice

For this exercise you are going to practice git fundamentals.  It is a best practice that when you want to make changes to a git repository, to first create a branch, make your changes to files, commit the changes to the new branch, then merge these changes back in the root.  That is what we will practice.  

You need to:

* Create a branch off of the practice branch
* Create a text file.  Follow this naming convention: firstname.txt.
  - Optional: Enter in your credit card, bank account, or other personal information into this text file that is open to the public.
* Add this file to your staging area
* Commit the changes to your branch
* Push those changes up to GitHub
* Create a pull request to merge your changes into the practice branch.  Be sure to delete your branch once the merge is complete.

Once you have successfully completed this practice, offer help to your fellow team members.  Once we have all successfully completed the practice, please checkout the `practice-main` branch.
