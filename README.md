# Getting Started
Welcome to Fairport Robotics software team!  Here are the steps to take to get started.

## First Steps

1. [Download and install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) git.
2. [Download and install](https://code.visualstudio.com/) VS Code.  There is [full setup instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).
3. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).  GitHub is where the team's software repository.
4. Authenticate with SSH
   - [Generate a New SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).  You may need to install SSH on your machine.  [This blog post](https://www.petergirnus.com/blog/how-to-use-ssh-on-microsoft-windows) gives step by step instructions on how to install SSH on widows.  Once ssh is installed you create your key. Use `ssh-keygen` to create a new key.  Make the email match what you used in GitHub.  **DO NOT** set a password!  If you do you will need to enter it every time you want to "save" a file. 
   - [Add the SSH Key to your GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
5. Clone this repository by opening a terminal window and typing `git clone git@github.com:FairportRobotics/getting-started.git`
6. Checkout the next-step branch by typing `git checkout next-step` in the terminal.
